The CUNY Graduate Center English Student Association sponsored a conference on
["Trance"](https://trancetheconference.wordpress.com/conference-schedule/). I
gave a talk titled ["Patterns of Trance Across the Tree of Life"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11dQKnGTVrlC9tIA1blgXOcnJuqiVKs6A3C8gQF_hSDg/edit?usp=sharing),
thinking about the biological underpinnings of trance and how these operate
across the tree of life.
