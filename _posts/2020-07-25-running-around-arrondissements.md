Problem: Sometimes running the same old route gets boring, and also it's nice
to have random (and pointless) personal goals.

Solution: Run the perimeter of each of the 20 arrondissement in Paris. Side
bonus, this is also a really great way to get to know the city.

Not done yet, but this is the progress so far. Will be updated as needs be.
