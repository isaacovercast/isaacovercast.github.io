Biodiversity is structured hierarchically across spatial, temporal, and taxonomic 
scales. It is therefore important to integrate across multiple axes of
biodiversity data when constructing models and performing inference. My core
research interest is in investigating the feedbacks among axes of biodiversity
data that accumulate across these different scales.
