Communities assemble in a geographic and environmental context. But to what
degree do shared geographic and environmetal contexts dicatate the community
structures we observe today? As part of my research program I seek to
understand how community genetic diversity is structured across spatial
scales and environmental gradients.

## Characterizing environmental conditions

My initial investigations are driven by a collaboration focusing on Coral
Triangle decapod communities. We first characterized local environmental
conditions by collapsing marine environmental variables into PC space, which
is illustrated in the following figure.

The inset shows the total environmental space of the region collapsed into the
first two PCs, and also indicates the environmental space occupied by the ten
sampling locations of the observed decapod communities. The larger panel shows
the environmental PC space projected across the whole landscape, clipped to
the locations where corals are known to exists. Here we see that the
evironmental space of the coral triange is quite broad and that the space
occupied by the sampled communities covers a significant fraction of this
environmental space.
