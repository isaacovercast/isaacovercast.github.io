Phylogeography is the study of population genetic variation in a geographic
context. Sequence data contains a record of the history of a species and we
can use statistical tools to make inference about this history. For example,
we may be interested in past population size changes or whether and to what
extent populations are structured across the landscape.

Comparative phylogeography extends this idea to investigate whether multiple
co-distributed species have undergone similar population dynamics (e.g.
bottenecks, expansions, populations splits) given the fact that they were
historically subject to the same environmental conditions.

Comparative phylogeographic methods were first developed for single locus
datasets, typically several hundred basepairs of a single mitochondrial marker.
Given that single locus data can give a biased picture of population history,
methods have advanced through time to support multi-locus data, and even
SNP data representing thousands of independent loci across the genome,
typical of RADSeq experiments. Recently, collaborators and I have developed
a comparative phylogeographic method for whole-genome data. We call this method
[Phylogeograpic Temporal Analysis (PTA)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FBCY63dHIbldReDzD71Kc7947o_74NAi).

A few figures to demonstrate the core concepts:

## Do shared demographic histories create similar patterns in the genetic data?

This figure depicts a principal component dimension-reduction of 2000
independent mSFS (multi-site frequency spectra) generated by simulating 10
co-expanding populations with identical co-expansion magnitudes, while only
allowing the time of co-expansion to vary. Each point is a simulation, and
the color of the point indicates the time of co-expansion. The figure indicates
that there are observable differences between the mSFS generated by assemblages
co-expanding at different times.

## Can we use machine learning to identify shared demographic histories?

This figure shows the confusion matrix of an ML classifier trained on a subset
of the simulated data, and tasked with classifying a subset of held-out
simulations as either representing fully asynchronous (Psi=0) or fully
synchronous (Psi=1) expansion times.

In these simulations there was a strong bias in the prior on Psi, which results
in biased classification. Not so good, but this is still exploratory development
work.

## Can we use machine learning to estimate model parameters relevant to shared demographic histories?

PTA is the only comparative phylogeographic method that can make use of the
information in whole-genome sequences, while fully accounting for linkage. We
also designed it to have a simple, modern interface, a massively parallel
backend, and an automated machine learning inference procedure. PTA is the most
advanced comparative phylogeographic method developed to date, and we're just
getting started!
