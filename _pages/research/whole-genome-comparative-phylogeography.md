Biodiversity is structured hierarchically across spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. It is therefore important to integrate across multiple axes of biodiversity data when constructing models and performing inference. My core research interest is in investigating the feedbacks among axes of biodiversity data that accumulate across these different scales.
