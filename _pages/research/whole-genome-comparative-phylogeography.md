Phylogeography is the study of population genetic variation in a geographic
context. Sequence data contains a record of the history of a species and we
can use statistical tools to make inference about this history. For example,
we may be interested in past population size changes or whether and to what
extent populations are structured across the landscape.

Comparative phylogeography extends this idea to investigate whether multiple
co-distributed species have undergone similar historical population dynamics
(e.g. bottenecks, expansions, populations splits) given the fact that they
were historically subject to the same environmental conditions.
