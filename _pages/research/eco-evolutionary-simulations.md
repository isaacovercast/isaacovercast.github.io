Biodiversity is structured hierarchically across spatial, temporal, and
taxonomic scales. It is therefore important to integrate across multiple
axes of biodiversity data when constructing models and performing inference.
My core research interest is to investigate the feedbacks among axes of
biodiversity data that accumulate across these different scales. I primarily
develop individual-based, mechanistic models, and apply statistical analysis
with a focus on emerging machine learning methods.
