Materials from various workshops I have organized and contributed to. Workshop
materials are normally sufficiently detailed to serve as stand-alone tutorials.
In general the most recent workshop will have the most up-to-date information,
but each workshop is slightly different, and the older materials should still
contain some useful information.

RADSeq Assembly and Analysis
----------------------------
[RADCamp workshops](https://radcamp.github.io/) are designed to introduce
[ipyrad](https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io), a unified and self-contained RADSeq
assembly and analysis framework, which emphasizes simplicity, performance, and
reproducibility. In these workshops we proceed through all the steps necessary
to assemble a typical RADSeq dataset. Additionally, we introduce the ipyrad
‘analysis’ API which provides a powerful, simple, and reproducible interface to
several widely used methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships,
population structure, and admixture.

* [RADCamp Yale](https://radcamp.github.io/Yale2019/) (2019; ½ Day; Yale University)
* [RADCamp IBS](https://radcamp.github.io/IBS2019/) (2019; Full Day; International Biogeography Society meeting, Malaga, Spain)
* [RADCamp NYC](https://radcamp.github.io/NYC2018/) (2018; 3 Day; Columbia University)
* [RADCamp AF-BIOTA](https://radcamp.github.io/AF-Biota/) (2018; 3 Day; University of São Paulo, Brazil)

Model-based inference in Phylogeography from single species to communities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CompPhylo workshops](https://compphylo.github.io/) are designed to introduce a
myriad of tools for making statistical inference about historical processes
using genetic/genomic data. After introducing statistical approaches in
model-based inferences, participants will be introduced to inference frameworks
that span taxonomic scales from single-species demographic inference, to
multi-species comparative analysis, to inference at the scale of the whole
community. Participants will also get hands on experience using approximate
Bayesian computation, supervised machine learning and composite likelihood
methods for model comparison.
