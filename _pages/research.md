Biodiversity is structured hierarchically across spatial, temporal, and
taxonomic scales. It is therefore important to integrate across multiple axes
of biodiversity data when constructing models and performing inference. My core
research interest is in investigating the feedbacks among axes of biodiversity
data that accumulate across these different scales. Learn more about my specific
research interests below:
