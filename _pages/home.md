I am interested in the feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes
and the mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity using computational
models, multidimensional biodiversity data, and machine learning inference
approaches. The goal of this work is to improve our understanding of how
biodiversity has accumulated in the past in order to better predict how it will
change in the future, specifically in the context of anthropogenic habitat
disturbance, biological invasions, and global climate change. A unifying object
of investigation in my work is the aggregated intraspecific genetic variation
within ecological communities1 (the genetic structure or "genetic health") which
is critical for conservation and remediation efforts, yet which is poorly
understood at this time.
