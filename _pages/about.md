I am a computational biologist by training, with a background in computer
science, and postdoctoral experience in stochastic modeling of biodiversity.
In my research I develop and apply computational models and machine learning
methods to multidimensional biodiversity datasets, with the goal of
understanding and predicting the response of biodiversity to global change.

I am currently a Research Scientist at the California Academy of Sciences, where I am
developing a Biodiversity Resilience Model in association with the 
[Islands 2030 initiative](https://www.calacademy.org/about-us/major-initiatives/islands-2030).

From 2022-2023 I was a postdoc in the [EcoEvoMatics Lab](https://www.ecoevomatics.org/)
with Andy Rominger at the University of Maine. My work here revolves around
continued development and application of our Rules of Life Engine (the RoLE
model), which unifies ecological and evolutionary processes to better understand
how biodiversity is generated and maintained. The NSF award abstract for this
project is here: [Award # 1927319](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1927319&HistoricalAwards=false).

From 2019-2021 I was a postdoc in the Morlon group at Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole
Normale Superieure in Paris, where I developed theory and models of island
biodiversity genomics. My position was associated with an EU funded (Horizon
2020) project which you may learn more about at the website:
[http://www.ibiogen.eu/](http://www.ibiogen.eu/).

I earned my PhD in 2020 at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York
under the supervision of Dr Michael Hickerson (Thesis: *On the Distribution of
Genetic Variation in Ecological Communities*).
