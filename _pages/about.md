I have a background in computer science, artificial intelligence, and theory
of computation. After spending some time working in industry I grew tired of
solving routine 'mechanical' IT problems and decided to return to academia to
pursue my PhD in evolutionary biology, under the assumption that evolution,
as a highly stochastic and contingent process, would provide more interesting
challenges. Turns out I was right on one front, but wrong on another. Evolution
is indeed characterized by contingency and stochasticity, but *modelling* the
uncertainty of evolutionary processes is a wildly interesting project, given
that theory and modelling are all about developing mechanistic models of
non-deterministic processes.

My core research revolves around several themes, the binding element of which
is comparative population genetics. One target of my research is to characterize
and develop models to explain the distribution of genetic variation in ecological
communities. A related focus is to develop models of how biodiversity
accumulates in ecological communites that integrate over multiple levels of
biological organization, including species abundances, genetic diversities,
and phylogenetic relationships. Expanding beyond individual communities, I am
also interested in constructing machine learning models which use observed
community-level data along with environmental data to identify environmental
correlates of commuity abundance and genetic diversity structure. Finally, I
construct inferential frameworks utilizing whole-genome data to understand how
geographically co-distributed taxa have or have not concordantly responded
to fluctuating shared environmental conditions.
